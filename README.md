# POC of what was once part of the iOS Netflix app UI. - CollectionView (or at least horizontally scrolling items) with TableView Cells (vertically scrolling).

# Worth noting
* TableView and CollectionView Datasource abstraction. Configuring a datasource with a single line of code.
* Custom expand transition (Similar to what Nextflix once did)
